= switch-window

== Window switching, the visual way.

Check out this http://tapoueh.org/emacs/switch-window.html[screenshot], then install the
+switch-window.el+ file here (with http://github.com/dimitri/el-get[El-Get] or
https://melpa.milkbox.net[MELPA] it's even easier).

== Installation

Rebind your +C-x o+ key:

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x o") 'switch-window)

If you do not use El-Get or ELPA, you need to require the package first:

  (require 'switch-window)
